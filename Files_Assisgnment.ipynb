        "\n",
        "* **Interpreted languages** execute code line by line, making them easier for debugging but usually slower.\n",
        "* **Compiled languages** convert the entire code into machine code before execution, leading to faster runtime but longer setup.\n",

        "### **2. What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Exception handling allows the program to deal with unexpected errors without crashing. It uses `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to catch and respond to errors.\n",
        "**Example**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    result = 10 / 0\n",

        "\n",
        "The `finally` block always executes after `try` and `except`, regardless of whether an exception occurred. It is typically used to release resources like closing files or connections.\n",
        "**Example**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    f = open(\"file.txt\", \"r\")\n",

        "### **4. What is logging in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Logging is used to record events, errors, warnings, or other messages during program execution. It helps in debugging and tracking program flow without using `print()` statements.\n",
        "**Example**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import logging\n",
        "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n",

        "\n",
        "`__del__` is a destructor method automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed. It's used to clean up resources like files or connections.\n",
        "**Example**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Demo:\n",
        "    def __del__(self):\n",

        "\n",
        "* `import module` imports the whole module; access requires the module name.\n",
        "* `from module import function` imports specific components directly.\n",
        "  **Example**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import math\n",

        "\n",
        "You can use multiple `except` blocks or combine them in a single block using a tuple.\n",

        "### **8. What is the purpose of the `with` statement when handling files?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `with` statement ensures that a file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an error occurs.\n",
        "**Example**:\n",

        "\n",
        "### **9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Multithreading**: Multiple threads share the same memory space; suitable for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
        "* **Multiprocessing**: Each process has its own memory; ideal for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "  **Example**: Use `threading` for web scraping, `multiprocessing` for heavy calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Tracks errors and program flow\n",
        "* Logs can be saved for audit\n",
        "* Different log levels help in filtering\n",
        "* Can be used in production without cluttering the output\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **11. What is memory management in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses a private heap and automatic garbage collection. Memory is managed using reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector that frees memory used by unused objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **try**: Code that may raise exception\n",
        "2. **except**: Handles specific exception\n",
        "3. **else**: Runs if no exception\n",
        "4. **finally**: Always runs (cleanup)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **13. Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Efficient memory management prevents memory leaks, improves performance, and ensures the application runs reliably, especially with large or long-running programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **14. What is the role of `try` and `except` in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `try`: Contains code that might throw an exception\n",
        "* `except`: Defines what to do if an exception occurs\n",
        "  **Example**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    print(1 / 0)\n",
        "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
        "    print(\"Handled divide by zero\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses reference counting to track object usage. When an object’s reference count drops to zero, it is deleted. It also uses a garbage collector to clean up circular references.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **16. What is the purpose of the `else` block in exception handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `else` block runs only if no exception was raised in the `try` block. It’s useful for code that should only run if everything went well.\n",
        "**Example**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    print(\"Hello\")\n",
        "except:\n",
        "    print(\"Error\")\n",

        "\n",
        "### **17. What are the common logging levels in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* DEBUG\n",
        "* INFO\n",
        "* WARNING\n",
        "* ERROR\n",
        "* CRITICAL\n",
        "  These levels help categorize the importance of the log messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **18. What is the difference between `os.fork()` and `multiprocessing`?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `os.fork()`: Unix-specific, lower-level, duplicates the current process.\n",
        "* `multiprocessing`: Cross-platform, higher-level API that manages separate processes with their own memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Closing a file releases system resources and ensures that all data is properly saved and written to the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **20. What is the difference between `file.read()` and `file.readline()` in Python?**\n",
        "\n",
        "* `read()`: Reads the entire file content at once.\n",
        "* `readline()`: Reads one line at a time.\n",
        "  **Example**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "f.read()      # entire file  \n",

        "It allows developers to track events that happen when software runs, which helps in debugging and monitoring applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **22. What is the `os` module in Python used for in file handling?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `os` module helps with interacting with the operating system — like creating, deleting, and moving files and directories.\n",
        "**Example**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import os  \n",

        "\n",
        "Use the `raise` keyword with an exception class.\n",
        "**Example**:\n",
